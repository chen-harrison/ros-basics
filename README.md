# ROS Basics

This repository holds the catkin workspace and the basic tutorial packages I've written while referencing the [*ROS Robot Programming*](http://wiki.ros.org/Books/ROS_Robot_Programming_English) textbook.

The book is written by TurtleBot3 developers from ROBOTIS. Their GitHub can be found here:
